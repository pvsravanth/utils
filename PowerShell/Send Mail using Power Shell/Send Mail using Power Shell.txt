During the very beginning of learning power shell one of the first scripts I wrote was to send a mail using outlook using power shell.
$o = New-Object -com Outlook.Application
Start-Sleep -s 10
$mail = $o.CreateItem(0)
$mail.importance = 2
$mail.subject = “subject“
$mail.body = “mail body“
$mail.To = “to@someone.com“
$mail.Bcc = “bcc@someone.com.com“
$file = “C:\Users\fdsf .txt”
$attachment = new-object System.Net.Mail.Attachment ($file)
$mail.Attachments.Add($file)
$mail.Send()
 
 
And the same one in batch file format looks like this.
Just remove the line dividers. Add @powershell to tell the batch job to use powershell and replace ” with ‘
@powershell $o = New-Object -com Outlook.Application;Start-Sleep -s 10;$mail = $o.CreateItem(0);$mail.importance = 2;$mail.subject = ‘sub’;$mail.body = ‘Please find the attached HTML file.’;$mail.To = ‘****’ ;$mail.Cc = ‘*****’;$mail.Bcc = ‘****’;$file = ‘C:\Users\xxzs.html’;$attachment = new-object System.Net.Mail.Attachment ($file);$mail.Attachments.Add($file);$mail.Send()
